#Implementations of Affinity in R, Hadoop Mapreduce and Spark

Affinity analysis is a techinque that discovers co-occurence relationships among activities performed by specific individuals or groups. In retail it is used to perform basket analysis.
Basket analysis may tell a retailer that customers often purchases shampooo and conditioner together. [1]

This blog tries to implement this analysis using several popular techniques, R, Scala & Scalding in Apache Hadoop, and Scala & Apache Spark. The idea can also be implemented in other
techinques such as Java Mapreduce, Python, etc.

Let's look at the problem below.

## Problem
The sales data are recorded in a csv file. There are three fields, orderid, product and quantity. We will find out the quantity that every groups of product are purchased together (same order).
A small sample data are listed.
