## Useful References

Below are some useful references that helped me prepare to interview for jobs as a data scientist:

## SQL/Database Preperation:

* I found [Bill Howe](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/)'s Introduction to Data Science Coursera 
  course to be very helpful when learning about SQL and methods for analysing big data ([Coursera link](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci)). 
  In particular, I found the section "Relational Databases, Relational Algebra" a very good introductin to
  what is so great about SQL databases. Note that you can watch the lectures without 
  taking the class by clicking on [Preview Lectures](https://class.coursera.org/datasci-001/lecture/preview) 
  if it is not currently being offered or you have limited time.

## Machine Learning Preperation:

* [Andrew Ng](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/)'s coursera machine learning class 
  ([Coursera link](https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture/preview)). Note, you can watch the lectures without offically 


To help learn CS fundamentals and prepare for the technical coding interview:

* 2 books to prepare for technical interviews:
  * Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming 
    Questions and Solutions ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)).
  * Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job 
    ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Programmer/dp/047012167X)).
* The Stanford Algorithms lecures on Coursera are 
  very good: [part1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) 
  and [part2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2). Note, 
  you can watch the lectures without offically taking the class 
  through the preview link.

## Probability and brainteaser questions

* To prepare for probability and brainteaster questions, I studied from 
  [Timothy Crack](http://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/falconcrack.html) book
  "Heard on the Street: Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews"
  ([Amazon link]([http://www.amazon.com/Heard-Street-Quantitative-Questions-Interviews/dp/0970055293/)).
  Despite being aimed at people looking to move into finace, many of the topics were useful
  to prepare from.
